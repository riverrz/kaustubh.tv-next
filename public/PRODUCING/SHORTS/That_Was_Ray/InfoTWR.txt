Synopsis: That Was Ray" chronicles the life of Reverend Raymond “Ray” Broshears. Ray was at the forefront of the San Francisco gay rights movement in the late 60s to mid-70s. While he preached peace and acceptance, he also founded a militant group, “The Lavender Panthers”, which curbed hate crimes with the threat of violence. He was a radical and polarizing figure who fought violence with violence, alienating himself from his fellow gay-rights activists and straight peers alike. Due to their controversial methods, Ray and the Panthers were largely forgotten, until now.
